    <h3>What's it</h3>
    <p>A rich, versatile meat sauce: serve it Bolognese-style with spaghetti or use it as a base for lasagne or moussaka</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, halved and finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 celery stick, finely diced</li>
        <li>1 large carrot, finely diced</li>
        <li>600g pack minced beef steak</li>
        <li>3 tbsp tomato purée</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, finely grated</li>
        <li>2 tsp fresh thyme leaves</li>
        <li>150ml red wine (or use extra beef stock)</li>
        <li>500ml beef stock</li>
        <li>400g spaghetti</li>
        <li>50g grated parmesan, plus extra to serve (optional)</li>
        <li>side salad, to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large pan and add the onion, celery and carrot. Fry over a medium heat for 10 mins, stirring now and then, until softened and starting to colour.</li>
        <li>Stir in the mince and cook, breaking up any clumps of meat with a wooden spoon, until browned.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato purée, garlic and thyme, and cook for 1-2 mins more. Pour in the wine, if using, and increase the heat to boil off most of the alcohol. Reduce the heat, stir in the stock and season. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and leave to cook gently for 1 hr-1 hr 15 mins until the meat is tender and the sauce has thickened.</li>
        <li>Remove the lid and continue cooking for 15 mins. Meanwhile, cook the pasta following pack instructions. Reserve a mugful of the cooking water, then drain the spaghetti and add to the ragu with the Parmesan. Toss well and add a little pasta water to help the sauce coat the spaghetti. Serve with a side salad and extra cheese, if you like.</li>
    </ol>
